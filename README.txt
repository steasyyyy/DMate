DMate is an Android app that allows diabetics to track their 

bloodsugar, 
breadunit consumption, 
bolus and basal insulin injections,
sportive activities,
and insulin factors.

Additionally the app advises users to use certain insulin factors depending on the time of the day.
While doing this, the app learns from earlier calculations, injections and their bloodsugar value results 
which makes it possible for the app to adjust the users insulin factors to achieve better values overall.
