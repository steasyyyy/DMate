DMate is an Android app that allows diabetics to track their 

bloodsugar, 
breadunit consumption, 
insulin factors, 
and bolus and basal insulin injections.

Additionally the app advises users to use certain insulin factors depending on the time of the day.
While doing this, the app learns from earlier calculations, injections and their bloodsugar value results 
which makes it possible for the app to adjust the users insulin factors to achieve better values overall.

For now, this project is in an early development state. However, the aim is to publish the app in the Google Play Store
to make it available for all Android users.
